<!--
    6. HTML structure
    head = contains all element that are not visible like website title
    body = contains all element that visible

    in previous examples we did all the coding without these html structure
    but without it we are missing important features

    LIVE SERVER extension: allows us to automatically see
    changes when save html files by loading it into live server
        -by right click > Open with live server
    LIVE SERVER doesn't work if we DONT HAVE html structure

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Basics</title>

    </head>
    <body>
        <p>paragraph of text</p> 
        <p>paragraph        of text
            hello
        </p> 
        <button>Hello</button>
        <a href = "https://www.youtube.com"
        target="_blank">Link to Youtube</a>

            indent
        </button>
